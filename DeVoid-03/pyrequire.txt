### [NOTE]
# Note that for one-time builds, e.g. for CI/testing, on platforms
# that are not covered by one of the wheel packages provided on PyPI
# and the pure Python wheel that we provide is not used, it is
# substantially faster than a full source build to install an
# uncompiled (slower) version of Cython with:
## pip install Cython --install-option="--no-cython-compile"
